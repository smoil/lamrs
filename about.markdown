The Los Angeles Model Railroad Society, a diverse group of model railroad enthusiasts, has been
promoting the hobby of model railroading for over forty years.

We welcome all levels of model railroaders into our organization and strive to get new members
involved with running model trains, railroad operations, and working on the club's new layout.

The Society strives to enhance the development and enjoyment of the hobby with events such as how-to
clinics, group outings, operating sessions and hosting other model railroad clubs and organizations.

### Public Events

The Society hosts several events for the public each year, including:

* Free Open Houses
* Guest Conductors: Kids run trains on our layout

  - Torrance Public Library

### History & Layout

The club was founded as the Pacific Coast Train Club in 1971. The club became a 501(c)(3)
organization in 1997 and was renamed the Los Angeles Model Railroad Society.

We have been featured in *Model Railroader Magazine* and numerous model railroad association tours,
publications, naitonal television shows, commercials, even a music video! In 2022, the Society began
building a layout at our new location in Harbor City, CA.
