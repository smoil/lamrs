The layout is currently still in the planning stage and awaiting some alterations to the building.
The layout will be point to point with three levels of shelf type bench work. The lower level with
be staging and will serve both ends of the layout. In concept it will be two different locations.
The middle level will be the east end to the middle point of the layout. The upper level will be the
west end to the center of the layout. The two center points of the layout will be connected by a
helix and each end point of the layout will be connect to the staging level by separate helixes.
Trains departing staging will have the option to go either east to west or the other way around.
Trains arriving to staging can be turned around and restaged to run again as a different train.
