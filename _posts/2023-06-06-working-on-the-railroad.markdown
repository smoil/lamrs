New and existing members are presented with a rare opportunity to participate in building the next
generation layout from the ground up. Here is a chance to develop your skills using modern
technologies along with tried-and-true techniques.

The Society is recruiting new adult members to join us in this venture. We also offer a Juniour
Member Program, where a parent and child can participate together in the creation of this new
layout.

In addition, the Society is seeking new ways to partner with community organizations, schools,
youth groups and senior citizen organizations for the benefit of all.

We look forward to welcoming you to the Los Angeles Model Railroad Society as we enter this exciting
new phase in the world of model railroading. [Contact us](/contact/) for more information on how to become a
member.
